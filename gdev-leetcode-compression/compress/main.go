Given a non-empty string, encode the string such that its encoded length is the shortest.
The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times.
Note:
k will be a positive integer and encoded string will not be empty or have extra space.
You may assume that the input string contains only lowercase English letters. The string's length is at most 160.
If an encoding process does not make the string shorter, then do not encode it. If there are several solutions, return any of them is fine.
